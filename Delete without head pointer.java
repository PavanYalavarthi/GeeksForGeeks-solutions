You are given a node del_node of a Singly Linked List where you have to delete this given node from the linked list but you are not given the head of the list.

After deleting the given node:

The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before & after the del_node node should be in the same order.
Note: It is guaranteed that there exists a node with a value equal to the del_node value and it will not be the last node of the linked list.
